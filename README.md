# Image Search App built in React ü™ê

Tech Test style project with [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/).

View deployed project [here](https://helidevine.github.io/nasa-image-search/)

Brief for the project:

Build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space and use provided NASA API endpoint for image search.

The following functionalities need to be implemented:

-   A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
-   Images must be returned upon a successful search

The app also shows an error message if there are no images related to search keyword.

**Set up**

To run the app locally clone this repo and install following:

Install axios so app can access API

### `npm install axios`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

Jest and React Testing Library was used to test the app's functionality outside the browser.

To run tests:

### `npm test`

**Project status**

Project is complete but if I have had more time I would have made the app responsive on mobile screen and improved the styling in general.
